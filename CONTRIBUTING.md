# Contributing to Alteryx to Databricks Migration Framework

First off, thank you for considering contributing! This project converts Alteryx workflows into deployable Databricks Asset Bundles, and it's designed to be extended — especially around adding support for new Alteryx tools. Contributions of all sizes are welcome, from fixing a typo in the docs to adding a whole new tool mapping in the parser.

## Code of Conduct

This project follows a Code of Conduct to ensure a welcoming and harassment-free experience for everyone.
> TODO: Add or link a `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` (e.g. the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/)). By participating, you're expected to uphold it.

## Getting Started

### 1. Repository Setup

Fork the repository, then clone your fork:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/for_alteryx.git
cd for_alteryx
```

Add the upstream remote so you can keep your fork in sync:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/Mourya-s/for_alteryx.git
```

### 2. Development Environment

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To work on the migration pipeline itself, you'll want:

- Python 3.x
- Access to a Databricks workspace (for testing end-to-end deployment)
- A Gemini API key (free tier is fine for local iteration)
- A sample `.yxmd` (and `.yxmc` macros, if relevant) to test parser changes against — `workflows/Sample_Workflow1.yxmd` is included for this purpose

## Branch Naming Conventions

Create a new branch off `main` for each change, using one of the following prefixes:

| Prefix | Use for |
|---|---|
| `feature/` | New functionality (e.g. `feature/crosstab-tool-support`) |
| `fix/` | Bug fixes (e.g. `fix/macro-parsing-error`) |
| `docs/` | Documentation-only changes (e.g. `docs/update-readme-setup`) |
| `refactor/` | Non-behavioral code restructuring |
| `test/` | Adding or updating tests |
| `chore/` | Tooling, dependencies, CI config, etc. |

```bash
git checkout -b feature/crosstab-tool-support
```

## Commit Message Conventions

This project follows [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
<type>(<optional scope>): <short summary>

<optional body>
```

Common types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`.

Examples:

```
feat(parser): add support for CrossTab tool
fix(generator): correct join key mapping for Union tool
docs(readme): clarify macro upload requirements
```

Keep the summary line under ~72 characters, written in the imperative mood ("add", not "added").

## Pull Request Process

1. Make sure your branch is up to date with `upstream/main` before opening a PR:
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git rebase upstream/main
   ```
2. Ensure your change:
   - Includes a clear description of **what** changed and **why**
   - References any related issue (e.g. `Closes #12`)
   - Includes tests or a sample workflow demonstrating the change, where applicable
   - Updates relevant documentation (README, inline comments, this file) if behavior changes
3. Open the PR against `main` and fill out the PR template.
4. Ensure CI (the `alteryx-migration.yml` workflow, plus any future test workflows) passes.
5. Respond to review feedback — a maintainer will merge once approved.

## Coding Standards

- Follow **PEP 8** for Python code.
- Prefer clear, descriptive names over abbreviations — this codebase is read by contributors extending the parser's tool mappings, so clarity matters more than brevity.
- Keep parser tool-extraction methods (`_extract_<tool>_config`) self-contained and consistent with the existing pattern shown in the README's [Extending the Parser](README.md#extending-the-parser) section.
- Avoid breaking changes to `workflow.json`'s schema without updating `generator.py` and documenting the change.

## Testing Expectations

- If you add support for a new Alteryx tool, include a minimal sample workflow (or a snippet of one) that exercises the new tool mapping.
- Verify the parser output (`workflow.json`) matches the expected structure for your new tool.
- Where possible, confirm the generated PySpark/Databricks code from `generator.py` runs correctly against sample data.
- Check `validate.log` output for your change and include it or a summary in the PR description if relevant.

> TODO: Formalize an automated test suite/CI test stage — currently validation is primarily manual via `validate.log`.

## Documentation Guidelines

- Update `README.md` if you change setup steps, supported tools, secrets/configuration, or the pipeline flow.
- Keep diagrams in `docs/images/` and reference them with relative Markdown image links.
- Write in clear, concise language; prefer diagrams or tables over long paragraphs when describing structure or flow.
- Use fenced code blocks with language hints (` ```python `, ` ```yaml `, etc.) for all code samples.

## Issue Reporting Guidelines

When opening an issue, please include:

- A clear, descriptive title
- Steps to reproduce (for bugs), including the Alteryx tool(s) involved if parser-related
- Expected vs. actual behavior
- Relevant snippets from `workflow.json`, `llm_output.txt`, or `validate.log` (redact anything sensitive)
- Your environment (Python version, Databricks runtime, OS)

For feature requests, describe the Alteryx tool or capability you'd like supported, and — if possible — a sample workflow structure that uses it.

> TODO: Add issue templates under `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` (bug report, feature request).

## Review Process

- All PRs require at least one maintainer review before merging.
- Reviewers will check for: correctness, consistency with the existing parser/generator patterns, documentation updates, and CI passing.
- Please be patient and responsive — most review feedback is aimed at keeping the parser extensible and the generated code reliable across a wide range of Alteryx workflows.

## Best Practices & Repository Etiquette

- Keep PRs focused — one feature/fix per PR rather than bundling unrelated changes.
- Don't commit contents of `generated/` from your own local runs unless the change is specifically about fixing generation logic — treat it as build output.
- Never commit real Databricks tokens, API keys, or workspace URLs; use the documented GitHub Secrets instead.
- Be respectful and constructive in issues, PRs, and reviews.
- When in doubt about a design decision (e.g., whether a tool should be treated as a reporting tool and skipped), open an issue to discuss before investing significant work.
